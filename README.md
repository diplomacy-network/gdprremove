Simple script to remove a user from a webdiplomacy database

# Important
- [ ] Cross check your data schema (does not apply for dnw as it is tailored for this platform)
- [ ] Update variables @uid as the users id and @deletedpassword as a random string in quotation marks (e.g. "fhkfgj1314567389"). To be sure just use alphanumeric chars.
